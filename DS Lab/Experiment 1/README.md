#Experiment 1

##AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT:
To write a program that use both recursive and non-recursive functions to perform the following searching operations for a key value in a given list of integers.
i)Linear search  ii)Binary search

LINEAR SEARCH:
  Array:11,7,9,16,21,4,15,98,67,31
  key element to be search:15,99
###STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
