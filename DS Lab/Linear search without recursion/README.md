#AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT:
To write a program using non-recursive functions to perform the linear search operations for a key value in given list of integers.

##EXPLANATION: 
The linearsearch using non-recursive() method should be straightforward.It loops through the array starting from the beginning until it finds an element in the array that matches the val parameter . If the val argument was 15 the function would return -1.

###STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:
