#AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT:
To write a program using non-recursive functions to perform the linear search operations for a key value in given list of integers.

##EXPLANATION: 
The linearsearch using non-recursive() method should be straightforward.It loops through the array starting from the beginning until it finds an element in the array that matches the val parameter . If the val argument was 15 the function would return -1.

###STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:

Key element to be searched:15
1.Firstly,select the first element (11) as the current element.
2.compare 11 with the target element (15).
3.There is a next element,then set current element to next element and again compare the current element to the target element.
4.Then at position 6 the element is location is found.
5.Hence,the key element is found and exit the process.

key element to be searched:99
